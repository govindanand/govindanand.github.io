        		<h1>Vin Anand</h1>
				<p>I am a fourth-year undergraduate at University of California, Berkeley pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (EECS)
					 and Materials Science & Engineering. My interests lie in exploring the applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence on consumer
					  technologies to build the next generation of products and features. In the past, I have worked on digital media projects to assess subscriber
						 behavior -- characterizing user segments and building recommender systems through collaborative filtering and other advanced learning methods.
						  I have also worked with International Airlines Group to introduce and implement new autonomous systems to increase the efficiency and passenger
							 throughput  at Heathrow Terminal 5. I hope to use my engineering background and experience to build technology that improves the status quo
							 and helps people around the world.  <a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p>
