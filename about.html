		<h1>About</h1>
    <p class = "p-welcome">Listed below are details of some of my past experiences and publications. Aside from my coursework, I have research experience in nanotechnology with projects in polymers and inorganic nanoparticles for healthcare and therapeutic applications. More recently, I am co-authoring case studies with Dr. Pamela Park on the distinct attributes of global leaders. Aside from my research, I am also an avid runner and alternative rock enthusiast â€“ some of my favorite bands are The Strokes, Metallica and Pink Floyd!</p>
